Setting up 2 rpis to serve a docker swarm.
Ansible will be used to set up the rpis.
    x Install git
    + Clone this repo
    - Install docker, docker tools, and the visualizer. Create a docker swarm. Docker swarm handles automated load-balancing
    - create postgreSQL db and a backup on the second server
    - Set up ufw firewall on the nginx container
    - set up your router to forward to your ip address
    - set up your domain with no-ip service to forward to your address

I'll need to learn the following:

- Ansible
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html
    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ansible/index.htm
- Docker Swarm
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/
- ufw firewall
    https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/introduction-uncomplicated-firewall-ufw/
- postgreSQL replication
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-replication.html
    https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-replicate-postgresql-database/
- postgreSQL backup
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup-file.html

I'm going to start with Ansible.
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html

1. I'll need to run a script that installs Ansible and then have Ansible run a separate script.
It runs over SSH protocol by default so I don't need to install ansible, but I will need to add my key through a script.

I need to supply a password
# ansible -u pi -i /Users/thomasfrancis/Documents/ansible/hosts -m ping all --ask-pass -c paramiko
    # does not work
Because I'll need to supply a password for my servers, I'll just create a playbook and connect that way instead.

Decide how you're going to pass in credentials.


rpi1
hostname -I
192.168.1.33
192.168.1.34
public Ip
96.32.2.83
ssh pi@192.168.1.33
ssh pi@192.168.1.34
either one works

rpi2
hostname -I
192.168.1.35
192.168.1.36
public Ip
96.32.2.83
ssh pi@192.168.1.35
ssh pi@192.168.1.36
either one works

+ installed ansible on my mac
+ generate rpi ssh key
+ make draft email on gmail with public ssh key. Copy and paste onto the RPIs
+ removed other versions of python
+ add ansible to path in .zshrc

I'm going to disable password authentication for the servers.
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-passwordless-ssh-login/
It seems like it's more secure since key-based authentication relies on cracking the passphrase on your personal key.
https://serverfault.com/questions/334448/why-is-ssh-password-authentication-a-security-risk
I'm gonna add an ssh private key to my mac OS
https://fplanque.com/dev/mac/secure-ssh-private-keys-on-mac-osx-10-5
This worked in solving the password problem. I won't need to enter a password anymore.
Use the --become flag to sudo commands.


ssh pi@192.168.1.35
ssh pi@192.168.1.33

+ register ssh private key with my mac
    ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/rpi
+ ping -m all command on provided inventory
    ansible -u pi -i ~/Documents/yorha/rpi-hosting/hosts -m ping all
+ use a live command on all nodes
    ansible -u pi -i ~/Documents/yorha/rpi-hosting/hosts all -a "/bin/ls"
    # -a is for module arguments
+ change default ansible_python_interpreter from python to python3 as an inventory variable
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.11/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#adding-variables-to-inventory
+ set up and run an example ansible playbook
    ansible-playbook ~/Documents/yorha/rpi-hosting/tasks/hello-task.yml -u pi -i ~/Documents/yorha/rpi-hosting/hosts
+ print file name that was created
    /bin/bash ~/Documents/yorha/rpi-hosting/tasks/print-ls-hello-command.sh
+ delete the hello file that was created
    ansible-playbook ~/Documents/yorha/rpi-hosting/tasks/delete-hellofiles.yml -u pi -i ~/Documents/yorha/rpi-hosting/hosts
+ test if file exist (it should not)
+ edit default inventory on mac
    I'm going to export the ansible hosts variable to my hostfile for. I'll change this in the future.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21958727/where-to-store-ansible-host-file-on-mac-os-x
    ansible -i $ANSIBLE_HOSTS -m ping all
    I'll do it this way for now for clarity.
+ Set up pyenv correctly... again
    https://opensource.com/article/20/4/pyenv
+ create user thomasfrancis using ansible playbook

    I'll need to set up a password, otherwise I won't be able to log in remotely.

    I'll need to encrypt the password upon creation.
    https://www.edureka.co/community/83388/warning-appears-hashed-argument-encrypted-module-properly
    I'll need to install passlib python module.
    Error: crypt.crypt not supported on Mac OS X/Darwin, install passlib python module. crypt.crypt not supported on Mac OS X/Darwin, install passlib python module
    I needed to install passlib locally on my mac, not on the target machine
    It works. User thomasfrancis has the same groups as pi and the same authorized_keys so no password needed to login and I don't need to use -u pi anymore as flag.
    The base commands will be the following from now on:
    ansible -i $ANSIBLE_HOSTS all
    ansible $ANSIBLE_TASKS/[playbook] -i $ANSIBLE_HOSTS

+ set up keychain access on Mac
    https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac
    This warning came up:
    The -K and -A flags are deprecated and have been replaced
    by the --apple-use-keychain and --apple-load-keychain
    flags, respectively.  To suppress this warning, set the
    environment variable APPLE_SSH_ADD_BEHAVIOR as described in
    the ssh-add(1) manual page.
    This command worked for me:
    ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/rpi
+ use an ansible playbook to setup git config ==> I'll use a one-liner instead of setting up git config.
    I'll need it because I'll be cloning from a private repo.
    Looks like I'll use a plugin.
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/git_config_module.html
        + ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
            # already installed
    Storing credentials is not the way.
    Instead I'll run the username and password in the https request.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37841914/how-do-i-pass-username-and-password-while-using-ansible-git-module
    What occurred instead is I used a one-liner https git clone repo with the username and password included.
    This was definitely the simplest solution. I did not need to set up git config at all.
+ create a playbook that clones yorha repo and copies .env folders into their respective places

3pm - currently stuck on how to resolve nginx and docker swarm
https://www.nginx.com/blog/docker-swarm-load-balancing-nginx-plus/
It looks like we'll be using virtual IPs from the swarm (VIPs)
Because of the VIPs, it looks like nginx will be easier to configure and deploy with swarm.
The main goal right now is to simply deploy the build version of only the frontend. This is to test if this even works.
This is highly experimental and not production. However, there are certain things that I will keep in production from this experiment.

Experimental:
- docker hub frontend repo
- nginx configuration
Production:
- docker swarm initialization
- ufw settings
- monitoring if its set up
- semblance.us DNS configuration
- no-ip DNS configuration

I'll need to do these tasks in the following order:

- fork the current yorha repo into a new semblance repo
    # worry about the .env files later since you're only working with the frontend
- edit nginx configuration to point to the VIP of the frontend
    - study the nginx cookbook to determine what the configuration should look like
    This is possible because the VIP of containers is not only predictable, but also configurable
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-mode/
    https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/05/load-balancing-docker-swarm-cluster-nginx-reverse-proxy/
- upload only the nginx and frontend images to the docker hub repo
    - learn how to update the docker hub repo image over time
- use docker swarm on your rpis
    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/orchestration/
    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/swarm-deploy/
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/
    I turns out that I will need ansible to install docker engine on the rpis. I wish I just studied docker swarm instead of using nginx.
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
    I will not be using Kubernetes due to its complexity.
    https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-a-comparison
    I think I'll use the guide below. 
    https://howchoo.com/g/njy4zdm3mwy/how-to-run-a-raspberry-pi-cluster-with-docker-swarm
    - create an ansible command that changes the hostname of rpis
    https://howchoo.com/pi/how-to-change-the-hostname-of-your-raspberry-pi
    - create a playbook that installs docker engine on each node
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
    - create an ansible command for docker swarm init
    - copy the output for adding workers here
    - create an ansible command that adds the visualizer
- have semblance.us either point or forward to the no-ip address
- have no-ip address point to the rpi IP address + the appropriate port/domain name

Post-Experiment: Production build

- get postgresql running on rpis using ansible
    - create a playbook that installs postgresql
    - create a playbook that creates the user on postgresql necessary for docker
    - create a playbook that creates the database and starting data ONLY ON ONE NODE
    - create a playbook that replicates this data from one database to another
- edit the docker-compose configurations for development and production
    - remove volumes from production
- edit nginx container such that it will point to the backend container
- edit the backend such that it interacts with a real db
- upload the nginx and backend images to docker-hub
