I think I'll spin up a new environment based on their template docker container and see what I'm allowed to edit.

There is some limited editing ability.

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

example repo name

appsvcsample/static-site
https://hub.docker.com/r/appsvcsample/static-site

I won't be able to host this thing in time cuz I'll need more time prior to the presentation.
