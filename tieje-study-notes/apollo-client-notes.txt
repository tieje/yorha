I have a general idea of what to do, but I'd like to look at what the books says.
I'll do work in the morning and study at night.

I'll be skipping all the to the end chapter.
I had started this before, but I gave up when I realized that I need Redux and not Apollo since I wasn't going to use GraphQL.

GraphQL, React, and TypeScript

previewing the final result is looking impossible so far. It's loading forever. I'm just going straight to step 1 instead.

not sure what a .env file is and how it works.

It's a way to store and access variables globally in react. It's generally good for storing secrets.

Honestly, I don't really feel like I'm getting anywhere with this chapter. At least not where I want to be.
By the nature of the project, it's less about Apollo and more about the project as a whole.

There may be one good thing and it's that there is a public graphql URL that I can use a test for a test graphql project.

Creating the sample project:

yarn create react-app apollo-poke-practice --template typescript

The goal of this project is to use understand the apollo state management library.
I just want to implement it in the frontend code really. It might not be a wise idea to build out an entire application.

There is a significant amount of reading for me to do in the documentation. I'll need to implement caching in my future projects.

Local state is the one that I am most interested in.
