There are 7 topics that I'll need to study so far.
GraphQL might be a topic for later, but we'll see.

This is about 3.5 hours of studying per day.
These are all rather black hole topics.

I can fit in most of this studying in the morning and some in the afternoon.
I'll have about 3.5 hours to get work on the actual site then.

I took away most of the other things. It might be a good idea for me to simply do right now.
