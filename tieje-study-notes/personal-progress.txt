There are 7 topics that I'll need to study so far.
GraphQL might be a topic for later, but we'll see.

This is about 3.5 hours of studying per day.
These are all rather black hole topics.

I can fit in most of this studying in the morning and some in the afternoon.
I'll have about 3.5 hours to get work on the actual site then.

I took away most of the other things. It might be a good idea for me to simply do right now.

I'll need to know enough information to transition React Context to the Apollo Provider.
I may want to actually do the chapter in the book for this.

Apollo implementation is going to be easier than I thought since I'm not going to implement their state
management library, just their graphql query functionality.

I don't want to step on my teammates toes.
I'd rather that everyone struggle and learn than for me to get ahead in the application.

Alright, it's time for me to become a master of production.
I will need to:

- create a production build of my code and figure out what this means
- run a production build from docker
- run a production build from jelastic

There is a ton to do.

I'm going to need to learn how to use nginx really well...
Alright so I can deploy using docker compose from the github repo.
This makes things simple.

I'll need to create a docker compose file that runs production build of the website from nginx.

This is the main plan.

+ 1. Create a production build of the website.
- 1. Install nginx on a docker container and check out the website online. Play around with it.
- 1. Check out how data should be stored on a docker container. Volumes or no.
- 1. Check out how host from gunicorn as well as handle CORS
- 2. Host the website locally from a docker container with nginx. Make database configurations as well.
- 3. Host the website from jelastic using docker-compose.

What I'll need to:

- create a separate branch for building production mode

- Backend
    - install gunicorn on backend
    - configure django settings to host site from gunicorn
- DB
    - figure out how to serve the backend data to django and how to save it
- Frontend
    - yarn build in Frontend folder
    - install nginx on Frontend container

Oct 19
- set up nginx on docker container for the frontend

20
- create presentation and document
- research volumes

21
- set up gunicorn on backend docker container

22
- set up database and volumes on docker container

23
- set up jelastic docker compose
