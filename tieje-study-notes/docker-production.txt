The goal is to figure out what I need to do in order to run docker containers in production mode.

So there would be a production and a development docker-compose file.

So I'll need to create an additional .yml file like production.yml
to add configurations such as...

- removing volume bindings
- bind to different ports on the host
- setting environment variables
- specifying restart policy
- adding extra services like a log aggregator

https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#different-environments
Multiple compose configurations:
docker-compose.yml contains the base configuration.
-f option overrides this configuration

So what I'll need to do is host the docker container locally in the container.
I'll need to bind it to a port.
But I'll also need to allow other computers to access that port through a firewall of course.
This is part of web hosting.
I'll need to dig deeper into jelastic then.

It looks like I'm going to need to set up a docker hub repo.
Jelastic will pull this image from the docker hub repo and build it.

I'll push the docker container to the repo.
I guess when you think about it, it makes sense.
I can use the complete working container. I only need to push it.

I'm not supposed to do further configuration actually, which makes sense.

I'll need to create a second .yml file that will run in production mode.
I still need to look at togglebox to figure out how it's done their end first.

- create production mode .yml file
- push repo to dockerhub

I might not need to push a container if I can deploy it from the github repo.
