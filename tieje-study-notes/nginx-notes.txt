Looks like I'll need to learn how to use nginx as a web server.

The next logical step would be setting up load balancing on jelastic as well.

Ok so the production build is only a few files that will be run using nginx.
So I should be able to create this configuration locally.

I'm going to set up nginx in a vanilla ubuntu docker container.

I'll do this tomorrow. I have other soft skill things to build.
