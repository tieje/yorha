Learning how to set up email notifications for semblance using sendgrid.

Functions can get be used as decorators that the function below them as input.

def none_guard(func):


@none_guard
def somefunc(args, kwargs)
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return None if None in args else func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

Decorators allow us to use the function as input.
This creates a wrapper.
Instead of manually calling the wrapper every time its used, you can just call it once.

What is middleware?
It's standardized pieces of code that simplify communications between separate components such as with the backend and frontend.

I went to utils mainly because they're general functions used by everything. But I guess I don't really need those functions.

Probably not the best place to start.
I'm learning a bit about django, but what I should probably do is follow the book and then read the source code
if I'm confused about anything.

Next time read django for professionals and keep the source code open.
