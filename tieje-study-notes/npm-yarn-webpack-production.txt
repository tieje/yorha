react-scripts build already uses the best configuration of web pack under the hood for the website.
We generally don't really need to worry about it.

yarn global add serve

https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/global/
yarn add command adds a package to the current user package.

global is the scope

serve is a package that runs a static site. Our site is not really static.
I'll need to build a configuration for this site.


serve -s build

I ran

yarn build

I should have done this in another repo, but I guess this is my test for later.
