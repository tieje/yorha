docker-compose up -d nginx

docker exec -it yorha_nginx_1 /bin/bash

I moved the original docker-compose.yml and the override to the docker compose file folder so I can practice.

docker-compose up does not work very well with just isolating one service from multiple configuration files.

It's working now, so I guess I'll test out making some actual configurations.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build nginx

Supposedly, it's supposed to be docker compose without the up in the beginning at least

I don't want to set up a reverse proxy. I don't really need it since scaling is rather automatic anyways.

I'll set up a reverse proxy only because it is true that I should let each container specialize instead of handle many things.

I found out what the mime.types file is for:

enabling sendfile

Where to store and use configuration files.

https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/

The default.conf "includes" all the configuration files in conf.d/ folder.
All I need to do is create a configuration on top of the existing default configuration.
The default is like the base configuration in docker.

Extremely helpful

I'll need to see if I need to build a configuration for either sites-available or sites-enabled and the difference between them.

Actually... I'll need to set up a proxy pass because I'll be using this as a reverse proxy.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d --build

I'm so lost...
I don't know what to do...
I'll need to look at how nginx proxy pass works later as well as other people's configurations.
