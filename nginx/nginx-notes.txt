docker-compose up -d nginx

docker exec -it prod-nginx /bin/bash

I moved the original docker-compose.yml and the override to the docker compose file folder so I can practice.

docker-compose up does not work very well with just isolating one service from multiple configuration files.

It's working now, so I guess I'll test out making some actual configurations.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

Supposedly, it's supposed to be docker compose without the up in the beginning at least

I don't want to set up a reverse proxy. I don't really need it since scaling is rather automatic anyways.

I'll set up a reverse proxy only because it is true that I should let each container specialize instead of handle many things.

I found out what the mime.types file is for:

enabling sendfile

Where to store and use configuration files.

https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/

The default.conf "includes" all the configuration files in conf.d/ folder.
All I need to do is create a configuration on top of the existing default configuration.
The default is like the base configuration in docker.

Extremely helpful

I'll need to see if I need to build a configuration for either sites-available or sites-enabled and the difference between them.

Actually... I'll need to set up a proxy pass because I'll be using this as a reverse proxy.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d --build nginx

http://localhost:80

I'm so lost...
I don't know what to do...
I'll need to look at how nginx proxy pass works later as well as other people's configurations.

seems to work now.

It's an nginx problem, not a gunicorn problem.

The problem lies mainly with gunicorn and nginx. Supposedly there is a socket file that gunicorn is supposed to generate.
But it doesn't. So that sucks...
nginx is supposed to use this gunicorn socket file for it's interpretation.
It's so close. Text shows up fine.
I might need to delve deep into gunicorn and nginx to determine what the issue is...
Otherwise, there is alternative I could use...

https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html

Consider using this instead of gunicorn. I'm running into rather... unsolvable problems with gunicorn right now.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev-prod.yml up -d --build

docker-compose down --remove-orphans

I won't be able to use docker to set up a database. I'll need to rely on a database hosting service.
It shouldn't be that bad... I hope.

This might be it.
