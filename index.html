      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <p>Semblance is a website focused on local community-building by using technology to facilitate authentic
        real life interactions to avoid the substitution of tech for reality.</p>

      <div class="features">
        <h1>Connect with your local community</h1>
        <p>The internet allows us to connect with people all over the world but how often
          do you connect with people in your local community? Our goal is provide a safe platform
          where people can meet other people closeby with similar interests.  Expand your local community today!
        </p>
        <h1>Develop authentic relationships</h1>
        <p>When creating Semblance, we wanted to create an experience that connected people
          based on our unique Archetype technology.  Our unique system allows people to express their personality
          and connect with people who have similar interests.
        </p>
        <h1>Archetypes</h1>
        <p>We created a unique way for our users to match and search for other people!  Archetypes
          serve as a representation of our personality types and allow people to match on a deeper level.
        </p>

      <div class="about">
        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>Thomas had the idea for Semblance while talking with a college roommate who wanted to meet a fictional character in real life.</p>
        <p>"Well you can't meet them, but what if you could meet someone like them?"</p>
        <p>To avoid liabilities with character IPs and to avoid building a massive character database, fictional characters were simplified to their story-telling roots: <b><i>archetypes</i></b>.</p>
        <p>This is a project for fun and profit, but we will never sell nor publicly expose your personal information.</p>
