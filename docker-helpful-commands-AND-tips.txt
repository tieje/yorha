# For running on local web servers provided by their respective frameworks
# docker-compose.yml is the base that contains commands shared by all other compose files
# docker-compose up automatically runs docker-compose.override.yml file on top of docker-compose.yml.
# The above functionality is built into docker.
# You can access the containers from http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:8000

docker-compose up -d
or
docker-compose up -d --build


# For running production-like containers that use nginx and gunicorn to serve the frontend and backend, respectively.
# I'm not sure why nginx leaves up orphan containers that need to be removed with the --remove-orphans flag ðŸ˜¢
# You can access the containers from http://localhost:80/ and http://localhost:89/api/v1/

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev-prod.yml up -d --build
docker-compose down --remove-orphans

# reloading nginx whenever you make changes to the /nginx/sites-available/semblance.conf file
docker-compose exec prod-nginx nginx -s reload


# For running the real deal when you host elsewhere in the future.
# Please note that this will either fail or be insecure if the following things are not done:

- backend must be connected to a 3rd-party database hosting service.
- the server_names in /nginx/sites-available/semblance.conf file must be updated
- ufw firewall settings must be updated for the nginx container
- update semblance.us domain name to forward to the IP of our web hosting server

# This is basically untested as of 10/24/2021

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
